    abstract={"Phenomenological investigations of particpants with grapheme-colour synaesthesia – a condition wherein an inducer consistently and automatically triggers an additional concurrent perceptual experience – have revealed an apparent paradox. Namely, they describe the automaticity of their synaesthetic experiences as being both willed and automatic. Here we apply in-depth interviews and signal-contingent experience sampling to investigate the lived experience of a single case (HR) of synaesthesia to address this paradox. Our results suggest that for HR an inducer elicits a non-visual, spatially-localized, immediate, and intuitive knowledge about the concurrent. Critically, HR reports that in order to experience the concurrent visually, she must perform a specific mental gesture. We suggest that reporting on the former yields descriptions of concurrent experience as being automatic, and reporting on the latter yields descriptions of concurrent experience as being willful. Our findings demonstrate the need for detailed phenomenological investigations of the experince of synaesthesia, in order to develop more accurate descriptions of this experience."},
