## Summary
The third session of the 2021-22 TCW program features a panel between Nick Walker, Lizzie Huxley-Jones and KR Moorhead, who will be discussing the current academic landscape of neurodiversity studies as it pertains to creative writing and publishing, moderated by Hanna Randall.

## Description
Researchers and writers/editors discuss the current climate in academia and publishing in regards to neurodiversity, neurodivergent and neuroqueer voices. How can English and creative writing departments at Universities better accommodate neurodivergent lecturers? And how can teachers of creative writing better accommodate neurodivergent students? What does the future look like for neurodivergent/neuroqueer writers and how might we shape the publishing industry to get our voices heard?
